# About me

 I was studying Physics for my BSc and MSc degrees and currently I am a Computer Science PhD student in applied deep learning for medical imaging. I am also married and I run a technical [blog](https://olaralex.com). I have various interests in the field of deep learning and especially in computer vision but I enjoy reading about advancements in other subfields as well. 
 
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on computer aided diagnostics for pathology regarding colorectal cancer screening. We analyze and create new methods for automated whole-slide segmentation. I also particated, in a team of two, in a [DreamChallenge](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn20545111/wiki/594083) regarding automated scoring of joint damage, currently waiting for the results.
