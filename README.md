# About me

 I was studying Physics for my BSc and MSc degrees and currently I am a Computer Science PhD student in applied deep learning for medical imaging. I am also married and I run a technical [blog](https://olaralex.com). I have various interests in the field of deep learning and especially in computer vision but I enjoy reading about advancements in other subfields as well. 
 
ðŸ”­ Recently we got 2nd place and took the first prize of the [Covid CXR Hackathon - Artificial Intelligence for Covid-19 prognosis: aiming at accuracy and explainability](https://ai4covid-hackathon.it/accresults/). In this challenge we built the most accurate model that took the prize and also submitted a sophisticated Bahdanau-attention based model to create explainability attention maps.
 
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on computer aided diagnostics for pathology regarding colorectal cancer screening. We analyze and create new methods for automated whole-slide segmentation. I also particated, in a team of two, in a [DreamChallenge](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn20545111/wiki/594083) regarding automated scoring of joint damage and got 2nd (2nd subchallenge) and 3rd (1st and 3rd subchallenges) places.
